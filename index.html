        <p class="cipher-text">Systems are only as strong as the trust they uphold.</p>
        <p>I originally chose the name Trust-Worthy because it was available. Over time, it evolved into a philosophy — trust isn't optional in secure systems; it's foundational.</p>
        <p>I focus on privacy-preserving, security-conscious, and sustainable software design. My goal is to create tools that are ethically aligned, technically sound, and resilient in a hostile world.</p>
